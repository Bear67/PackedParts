value's taken from Orbital ConstructoCorp Parts.

Small Tank:
The OrbitalConstruction Mod used a Old T500 Fuel tank(T200 in today's game) and held 4000 rocket parts for the "Small" tank. But since the parts are now Packed, I'm using the T100 tank.

T200 Tank - 4000 RP's --> T100 Tank 40 PRP's

Medium Tank:
The OrbitalConstruction Mod used a x200-32 Fuel tank and held 60000 rocket parts. But since they're now Packed, I'm using the x200-8 tank, but instead of doing 600, doing 300 since the tank is 1/4 the size of the x200-32.

X200-32 Tank - 60000 RP's --> X200-8 Tank 300 PRP's

Large Tank:
The OrbitalConstruction Mod used a x200-64 Fuel tank and held 120000 rocket parts. But since they're now Packed, For the Large I'm using X200-32 Tank, if the x200-8 holds 3000 then the
X200-64 should hold 4 times that. 1200 PRP's.

x200-64 Tank - 120000 RP's --> X200-32 Tank 1200 PRP's

Extra Large Tank: (Needs KSPX)
